# Beer Css Web components

## About

[Beer Css](https://beercss.com) is great, but I don't like calling the `ui()` function everytime an element is added. So I'm making a web component version of this library. Check it out at [https://tomatopickle.github.io/beercss-webcomponents](https://tomatopickle.github.io/beercss-webcomponents)

## Installing

I don't know yet, will be available soon.

## Credits

This is mostly the work of [the contrbutors](https://github.com/beercss/beercss/graphs/contributors) at [Beercss](https://github.com/beercss/beercss/)
